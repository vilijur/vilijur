hi, i'm mainly a blender artist, but i do dabble in code here and there. most repositories are mods for games I planned to poorly translate but it turns out i was too stupid to do. Oops.

if you wanna see that list of stuff, look [here](https://github.com/vilijur/poor-translation-projects).

other then that, i'm kinda useless.. oh well, i'll do something eventually.
