hihi, i'm mainly a blender artist, but i do dabble in code here and there. most repositories on here are mods for games I planned to poorly translate but it turns out i was too stupid to do. Oops.

if you wanna see that list of stuff, look [here](https://github.com/vilijur/poor-translation-projects).

other then that, i do whatever i feel like doing that day of the week

most of the time it's nothing

i don't do much

that's cool i guess

oh yeah and i also dabble in like

android stuff

that's always fun

...until its not

ok that's all
